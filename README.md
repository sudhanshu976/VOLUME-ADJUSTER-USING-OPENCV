# Hand Gesture Volume Control

This Python script utilizes computer vision and hand tracking to control the system volume based on hand gestures. The volume is adjusted by measuring the distance between the thumb and index finger.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Numpy (`pip install numpy`)
- Pycaw (`pip install pycaw`)
- Handtracker (Make sure to have the `handtracker` module available, or adjust the import statement accordingly)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy pycaw
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the `handtracker` module available.

3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python hand_gesture_volume_control.py
   ```

4. Position your hand in front of the camera, and adjust the volume by moving your thumb and index finger closer or farther apart.

## Configuration

You can modify the script to adjust various parameters, such as the camera resolution, volume range, and visual representation of the volume bar.

- Camera resolution: Modify `wCam` and `hCam` variables.
- Volume range: Adjust the `minVol` and `maxVol` variables.
- Visual representation: Customize the `bar_width` and `bar_height` variables.

Feel free to experiment with these parameters to suit your preferences.
